## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a weather application that tells the weather for a desired location. The user is prompted to search for a city. When the search button is clicked, a new button appears below the search bar with the desired city name. Once clicked, the city name, current date, temperature, humidity, and wind speed are displayed along with a visual of the current weather condition. The forcast for the next 5 days will also appear
